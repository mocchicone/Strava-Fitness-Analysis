# Foresee Your Activity: A Strava Machine Learning Project
Machine learning project using Strava data.  Our goal was to create data visualizations, analytics, and predictive modeling that could help athlete improve their training plan.  Fitness data was collected and analyzed from two participants.  A database was created using SQLite.  Data visualizations and analysis were created using Tableau.  Finally, classification and regression machine learning was conducted in Python and Scikit-learn library.

## Tableu Visualizations:

We created a Location Analysis dashboard, that provides detailed data on each run as well as summary information on distance and temperature.

We also created a Performance Analysis dashboard.  In this example, we can see how much the user is running each month and how elevation change impacts his running speed.

## Predictive Analytics Using Machine Learning (Classification and Regression):

*Classification Analysis*
* Can we use machine learning to accurately predict the type of workout based on factors such as heart rate, start time, and length of workout?

*Regression Analysis*
* Can running pace be predicted based on elevation, heart rate, temperature, and athlete count?

Various machine learning algorithms were utilized to understand how they would perform with the data set.  In the classification summary table below we can see that support vector analysis provided the most accurate results.
