# Foresee Your Activity: A Strava Machine Learning Project
Machine learning project using Strava data.  Fitness data collected from two participants.  Database created using SQLite.  Data Visualizations created using Tableau.  Classification and regression machine learning conducted in Python.     

The Tableau storyboard can be found here: [Strava Tableau Analysis (https://public.tableau.com/profile/mike.occhicone#!/vizhome/StravaFitnessPredictiveAnalysis/FitnessTrackingDataOverview)


## Project Questions:

*Classification Analysis*
* Can we use machine learning to accurately predict the type of workout based on factors such as heart rate, start time, and length of workout?

*Regression Analysis*
* Can running pace be predicted based on elevation, heart rate, temperature, and athlete count?



## Executive Summary
CitiBike data from June 2020 through September 2020 was analyzed to determine trends.  Key findings include:

•	Service use has been increasing month over month although the overall increase was higher in men (+43%) than in women (+27%)  
•	Women are underrepresented at the top 25 start stations, ranging from 27% to 43% use when compared to men.  
•	Age data indicates that ridership numbers peak at 30 years old for both genders and both subscription types. 

## Data Collection
Citibike data was collected from June 2020 through September 2020 for New York city and consisted of 8.8 million records.  Records were segmented by subscription type, gender, age, trip duration, start location, and end location.  The data was collected from [CitiBike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).
